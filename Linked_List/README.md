Linked List Implementation in C++

Description
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of a Singly Linked List in C++. The Linked List is a dynamic data structure where each element (or node) contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. This implementation provides various functionalities, including insertion, deletion, searching, reversing, and more.

Features:

1. Insertion Operations:
  a)Insert at the head (beginning) of the list.
  b)Insert at the tail (end) of the list.
  c)Insert at a specific index (1-based indexing).

2. Deletion Operations:
  a) Delete from the head.
  b) Delete from the tail.
  c) Delete from a specific index.
  d) Delete by value.

3. Other Operations:
  a) Display: Print all elements of the list.
  b) Reverse: Reverse the entire linked list.
  c) Length: Get the current size of the linked list.
  d) Search: Check whether an element is present in the list.

Linked List Node Structure:
Each node in the linked list contains:

  1) val: The value stored in the node.
  2) next: A pointer to the next node in the list.

Conclusion:
This project provides a robust implementation of a singly linked list in C++, offering essential operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and more. The code is structured to be easy to understand and extend, making it a valuable resource for learning and applying the linked list data structure in real-world applications.
