# Singly Linked List Implementation in C++

## Description
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of a Singly Linked List in C++. A Linked List is a dynamic data structure where each element (or node) contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. This implementation provides various functionalities, including insertion, deletion, searching, reversing, and more.

## Features

### 1. Insertion Operations
- **Insert at Head**: Adds a new node at the beginning of the list.
- **Insert at Tail**: Adds a new node at the end of the list.
- **Insert at Index**: Inserts a node at a specific index (1-based indexing).

### 2. Deletion Operations
- **Delete from Head**: Removes the node at the head of the list.
- **Delete from Tail**: Removes the node at the tail of the list.
- **Delete from Index**: Removes the node at a specific index.
- **Delete by Value**: Finds and removes the first node with the specified value.

### 3. Other Operations
- **Display**: Prints all elements in the list.
- **Reverse**: Reverses the entire linked list.
- **Length**: Returns the current size of the linked list.
- **Search**: Checks if a specific element is present in the list.

## Linked List Node Structure
Each node in the linked list contains:
- **val**: The value stored in the node.
- **next**: A pointer to the next node in the list.

## Conclusion
This project provides a robust implementation of a singly linked list in C++, offering essential operations for managing a dynamic collection of elements. The code is structured to be easy to understand and extend, making it a valuable resource for learning and applying the linked list data structure in real-world applications.
