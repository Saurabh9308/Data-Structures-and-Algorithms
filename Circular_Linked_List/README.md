Circular Linked List in C++

This repository contains an implementation of a Circular Linked List in C++, providing various functionalities to manipulate and interact with the list, such as insertion, deletion, searching, and reversal. The code is designed to manage elements dynamically while maintaining the circular structure.

Features
  1. Insertions
    a) Insert at Head: Add a new node at the beginning of the list.
    b) Insert at Tail: Add a new node at the end of the list.
    c) Insert at Index: Insert a node at a specific index (1-based indexing).

  2. Deletions
    a) Delete at Head: Remove the node at the head of the list.
    b) Delete at Tail: Remove the node at the tail of the list.
    c) Delete at Index: Delete the node at a specific index.
    d) Delete by Value: Find and remove the first node with the specified value.

  3. Reversing the Circular Linked List
    The list can be reversed, maintaining the circular structure.

  4. Searching
    Check if a given value is present in the list.

  5. Display
    Display all the elements in the list.

  6. Size Calculation
    Get the number of nodes in the list.

Class Structure
  1. ListNode Class: Represents an individual node in the Circular Linked List, holding a value and a pointer to the next node.
  2. Circular_Linked_List Class: Implements the entire Circular Linked List and provides member functions for various operations.

Conclusion: 
This implementation of a Circular Linked List in C++ offers efficient and dynamic management of elements with support for various operations such as insertion, deletion, reversal, and searching. The circular structure ensures that the list loops back to the head, making it ideal for certain use cases like round-robin scheduling. This code provides a flexible foundation for further enhancements or integration into larger projects.
